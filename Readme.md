# Static webfiles
This repo contains example files for static web-pages in the ***content***-folder.  
These can be used to demonstrate e.g. Hosting a static website on S3 or running a Webserver (NGINX, Apache) in a container.  
I also use them for Labs/Playgrounds/Demos etc. to make it not look that boring.  

### Download files
Theres no need to clone the whole repo, you can download each file with:
```
click on the file > click 'raw' > right-click 'save as' > save to your computer
